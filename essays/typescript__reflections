##The Past

Many years ago I wanted to learn how to make a website. I didn't want to "cheat" and use another website to generate mine, I wanted to make everything myself. After a search on Google I decided on using JavaScript. This was before the plethora of online guides that we have today so I went to the library to check out a few books. And yes, one of them was "for Dummies"! I pored over the books and was fascinated with the way altering bits of the code could effect a quite different product than you started with. I even took them with me on an interisland trip. Unfortunately, I never did make that website.

Cut to my first year in college. I remembered how I didn't make the leap previously and thought to myself that this would be a perfect push, so I enrolled in a programming class. On reading the syllabus I was excited to see that the language we would be using was Java! Perfect, I thought, this will be easier for me since I had already read those books. Turns out it was not the case since Java is a different language altogether. The logic, though, remained the same.

##The Present

I'm currently taking a class that deals with TypeScript, a callback to my fuzzy memories of JavaScript with a new exciting layer of data types. This time around I'm under no illusions that having paged through some books ages ago will give me a leg up in learning TypeScript, but the similarities between other languages I've learned more recently certainly have. It's a comfort that there is some carryover and the format of the class is also helpful.

In this class we practice "athletic" programming. We have frequent drills in which we are given prompts and try to finish coding as quickly as we can.
